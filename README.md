This is our final project for course 553.667: Deep Learning for Discrete Optimization by Prof.Cook, at Johns Hopkins University, 2020.

We propose a framework to imrpove the Christofides heuristic via DNN. More precisely, we generate the spanning tree in the algorithm via a linear model, whose cost function $f$ is defined as the length of corresponding optimal Halmiltonian path of graph $T$.
The testing is still ongoing.
