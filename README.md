The final project by Hongda Qiu for course 553.667: Deep Learning for Discrete Optimization by Prof.Cook, at Johns Hopkins University, 2020.

Possible Plan TODO.

1. In this project, we build an algorithm to approximate the TSP problem, embossed with a DNN, based on the famous 3/2-approximation algorithm.

2. Reinforcement Learning on Simplex Method (finding proper entering variables)?
